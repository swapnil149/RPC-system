		QUESTION
  - -  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<div class="qa">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">Did you implement an rpcgenerate program and does it handle all legal IDL files? If not, which test cases should we try in your submission  directory?</li>
<li class="a">
  <strong>TODO</strong>
</li>

<li class="q">What programming language did you use for your rpcgenerate program?</li>
<li class="a">
Put an X in the space next to your choice:
<ul>
  <li>_____ C++ (using the provided type framework)</li>
  <li>__X__ Python (using the provided <code>idl_to_json</code>)</li>
  <li>_____ Ruby (using the provided <code>idl_to_json</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class="q">Briefly explain the protocol you use over TCP to request function calls and return the results.</li>
<li class="a">
<p>
Our protocol uses a stack and a heap as a sort of remote "shared" memory
abstraction. Right now we send the entire stack and heap, since we don't
<em>yet</em> have first class support for arbitrarily indexed pointers.
</p>

<p>
To add and remove data from shared memory, use "pack" and "unpack" functions,
these operations are order sensitive, so packed values must be unpacked in
reverse order. 
</p>

<p>
To interact with the heap we use an <code>rpcptr_t</code> type that
is a 32-bit value. Heap based operations are typically implemented by hand and
are supplied as part of the "initial basis" packers and unpackers in
<code>common/basis.h</code>.
The initial basis types include
<code>bool</code>,
<code>float</code>,
<code>int</code>,
<code>string</code>,
<code>rpcptr_t</code>.
The autogenerated packers and unpackers
compose these basic types to support structures.
</p>

<p>
Like traditional process memory, our heap grows up from zero and the stack
grows down from the highest address. This way if we run out of
memory, the entire structure can be resized without needing to change pointer
addresses, just simply move the stack to the new end of the buffer. This also
means that we can "compress" the memory, by not sending the unmapped middle
section.
</p>

<p>
To make a remote call, the client code does the following (all
autogenerated of course):
<ol>
<li>Load arguments into the shared memory with "pack" functions.
    These "packers" can use both the stack and the heap. This happens in same
    order as the parameters appear.</li>
<li>Pack the function name as a string value at the top of the heap</li>
<li>Send a message over TCP that contains three values, the total memory
    unit size (size of heap + size of stack), the
    <code>rpcptr_t</code> of the stack pointer (which is also the
    heap pointer, but that doesn't matter for unpacking), 
    and the shared memory buffer.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
To receive a remote call, the server code does the following:
<ol>
<li>Parse the memory unit size and stack pointer.</li>
<li>Unpack the function name from the memory unit</li>
<li>Send the memory unit to the correct function, which will then unpack 
    the rest of the data (in the opposite order it was packed).
</li>
<li>The server now calls the real function.
<li>The server packs the resulting value onto the memory unit.
<li>The server responds by sending back the same function name with another
</li>
</ol>
</li>
