    <h1>Report for Remote Procedural Call Protocol</h1>
    <h3>Jacob Zimmerman and Swapnil Gupta</h3>

    <h2>Underlying Mechanism: Heap and Stack</h2>
    <p>
      Fundamentally we don't want our RPC to limit the user. The whole point of
      RPC is that it is a <strong>huge</strong> abstraction. Therefore to
      prevent abstraction leak, we chose to make our RPC abstraction as
      unlimited as possible. To do this we match the exact capabilities of the
      client and the server.
